Daily Adventure Narrative

Plan your daily schedule and choose when to start your tasks according to a timer set by the user on 
how much time they wish to dedicate to the given task. As tasks are completed, a little animation
shows the user's avatar walking along a path to the next task to signify that progress is being made.
The user's tasks are also fed into Google's Gemini AI to assist the user in prioritizing tasks according
to the assigned priority value. Additionally, Gemini will generate short narrative stories to send back
to the user to offer a playful twist on task completion.
