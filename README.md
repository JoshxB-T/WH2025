Daily Adventure Narrative

Plan your daily schedule and choose when to start your tasks according to a timer set by the user on 
how much time they wish to dedicate to the given task. As tasks are completed, a little animation
shows the user's avatar walking along a path to the next task to signify that progress is being made.
